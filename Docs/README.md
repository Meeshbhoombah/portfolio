After many months of mishaps, I'm finshing my portfolio this week. This
portfolio will serve many purposes, most hidden to a vistor to the site.

In fact, a vistor's experience will be molded from the very beginning to
fullfill predefined journies which I can expect, or hope to encourage, a
user to take.

However, the foremost purpose of this site is to resurface my software 
flow. That's why my goal is to ship a v0 by the end of Saturday night.

I have always envisoned my portfolio site's homepage as a sort of digital
business card. At this point, I have Sketched a new iteration of the website
in a seperate file.

In retrospect, the portfolio's current conceptualized aesthetics reflect my
perception of the website's homepage as a business card.

But I hope to transcend this prespective of these pixels as simply paper 
pushers.

I've been coding and designing for many years now, and after seeings things 
like Framer I have always been curious about designing through code. It
felt awkward when I was younger, a novice programmer, but now I feel as 
though it could a catalyst for innovation. Through software the tangibility
of my vision becomes such that I can mold it, like clay, rather than cast it 
forth, like paint on a canvas. The former feels much more playful, like a
journey, whereas the latter feels devoid of intention, much moreso a 
projection of one's reality.

While that may seem insignificant, I think that this may be one of the greatest
changes I could attempt in my workflow. 

Anyhow, its time to set up the project. I'm using Typescript and React.
